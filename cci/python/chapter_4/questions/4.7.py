""" Build Order: You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies
    (which is a list of pairs of projects, where the first project is dependent
    on the second project). All of a project's dependencies must be built before
    the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built.
    If there is no valid build order, return an error."""
