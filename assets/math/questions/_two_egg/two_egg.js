/**
* Two Egg Problem
*
* A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be
* dropped from without breaking.
*
* If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped from
* that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again.
*
* Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking,
* with as few drops as possible.
