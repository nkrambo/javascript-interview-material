* Word Ladder
*
* Tags: Array, String, Backtracking, BFS
* Leetcode: 127
*
* Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the
* length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
*
* 1. Only one letter can be changed at a time
*
* 2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is
*    not a transformed word.
*
* For example,
*
* Given:
*
* beginWord = "hit"
* endWord = "cog"
* wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]
*
* As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
* return its length 5.
*
* Note:
*
* - Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* - All words have the same length.
* - All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* - You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* - You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
