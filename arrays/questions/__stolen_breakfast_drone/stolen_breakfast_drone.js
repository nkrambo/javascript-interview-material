/**
* Stolen Breakfast Drone
*
* Your company delivers breakfast via autonomous quadcopter drones. And something
* mysterious has happened.
*
* Each breakfast delivery is assigned a unique ID, a positive integer. When one
* of the company's 100 drones takes off with a delivery, the delivery's ID is added
* to an array, deliveryIdConfirmations. When the drone comes back and lands, the
* ID is again added to the same array.
*
* After breakfast this morning there were only 99 drones on the tarmac. One of
* the drones never made it back from a delivery. We suspect a secret agent from
* Amazon placed an order and stole one of our patented drones. To track them down,
* we need to find their delivery ID.
*
* Given the array of IDs, which contains many duplicate integers and one unique
* integer, find the unique integer.
*
* The IDs are not guaranteed to be sorted or sequential. Orders aren't always
* fulfilled in the order they were received, and some deliveries get cancelled
* before takeoff.
