/**
* Word Cloud Data
*
* You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word
* corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.
*
* To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds
* its word cloud data in a map ↴ , where the keys are words and the values are
* the number of times the words occurred.
*
* We'll use a JavaScript Map instead of an object because it's more explicit —
* we're mapping words to counts. And it'll be easier and cleaner when we want to
* iterate over our data.
*
* Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:
*
* 'After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:'
* 'Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar.'
*
* What do we want to do with 'After', 'Dana', and 'add'? In this example, your
* final map should include one 'Add' or 'add' with a value of 22. Make reasonable
* (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like 'After' and 'Dana'.
*
* Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.
*
* You could make a reasonable argument to use regex in your solution. We won't,
* mainly because performance is difficult to measure and can get pretty bad.
